Name: Image Classification project
Summary => what? and why?
=> The project:
I wanted to make a bot that impersonate a historical figure and speaks about it. The lesson I building this bot from is "The Age of Enlightement", it is here:
https://civics.sites.unc.edu/files/2014/03/Enlightenment.pdf

Why?
I found out that there is a lot of literature about bots and now within education and there is a debate about how useful they are in different fields. However, a recent study in 2018
found that they can be useful in delivering information and communicating with the students. Therefore, I want to investigate how useful they are in delivering hard topics.

goals:
=> the bot I aim to build will have a personality of one of the enlightment thinkers such as Rene Decartes
=> It answers the students questions
=> understand the intent of the sentence from the user using NLP and machine learning
=> Do sentiment analysis

Features:
=> Input sentence/ questions from the user => the bot will understand and respond


I will be using fastai and it does not work probably inside visual studio code, so i will either work on paperspace or google collab
I intend to use Responder which is a tool for visualizing your project I still learning how to use it. Jermey only mention it but never went through it so I'm learning it from the doc
I feel it's not hard, I need to visualize my project
