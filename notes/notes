programs:
consist of instructions and data
data is the information and in the lowest level is binary 0 and 1
code editor use the code but not excute it 
Python intpret the data and excute it

How you will intpret this input?

literal is a value that is not represented in the code
the varibale is for the programmer YAY!

file 
../ file.txt => relative

Array and string non primative values

exact = 
aliasing

Immutable = one I assigned a individual in a string you cannot change it

Values if you have two objects the compiler 

for x in range(len(y))
y[x]=y[x]+1

sorted(defining an array as an argument)
returns a copy of array in sorted order

y =[]
y.sort() 
in-place algorithms means changing the data and don't change it to another sort place 

Unity takes code and modules
