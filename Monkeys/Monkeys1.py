# #*Good Morning.or.equivalent, Coder 257d9,* 
# 
# >*Your A1 task for today is to type and compile the following code corrections.*
# 
# I KNOW how to correct code. I've been doing this every day for four and a half years.  Why do they insist on listing the instructions EVERY time?  High turnover? Legal boilerplate?  Or maybe to further denigrate the thought potential of humans. Who knows. I mean, we never see the same code 'cause' they don't want us to -- I don't know -- figure out how it works or undermine their control. As if.  But still, these instructions for our job NEVER change.  
# 
# >*The numbered lists will instruct you on how to alter the code. Please, follow the enumerated instructions and then press the button next to the previous code snippet.*
# 
# >*When you hover over ![Square brackts](http://markcmarino.com/jupyter/brackets.png)
# You will see this.
# ![Play button](http://markcmarino.com/jupyter/button.png)
# Press the Play button.*  
# You may also find the Table of Contents to useful for navigating tasks.   
# <-
# 
# >*You must comply with ALL instructions without deviation. Five or more errors will result in a postponement of your next holiday.*
# 
# >*Thank you for your 1624 days of service.*
# 
# 
# 
# 
#

# >*There are **3** days until your next holiday.*

# As if I couldn't count.  And so I begin my day of code alterations.

#  
#  Marta's one of the best coders I know.  So fast. It's like she speaks code as her first language.
# 
# Oh, and when you see a #, that means one of us codemonkeys was trying to figure out the code, leaving little notes for the others. (Like the one I typed about the variable names.) They usually get scrubbed out, when we're right about what the code actually does. In fact, that's the second Prime Law: No one shall know what the code does,  so...this one probably isn't even close.  You just never know. The codemonkey who had the code before you might've been a complete dolt.
